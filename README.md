## **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** 
is the value that determines how much a customer will leave financially from the communication process with me until they churn. So why? If we can determine the benefit our customers will provide us in the future, we can regulate our relationships with them accordingly and establish a medium to long-term customer-focused value-added strategy in our company. This will benefit the marketing department.

ðŸ’¡There is no time projection in calculating 'Customer Lifetime Value'. However, it will still be important in determining the value of existing customers. It can explain most of the calculations, there is no definitive calculation method.


**CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) * Profit Margin**

## **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**

can be called it probabilistic lifetime value estimation with time projection.

**CLTV = BG/NBD Model * Gamma Gamma Submodel**


**CLTV = Expected Number of Transaction * Expected Average Profit**


### **The BG/NBD Model**

Probabilistically models two processes for the Expected Number of Transaction.

Transaction Process (Buy) + Dropout Process (Till you die)

### **Gamma-Gamma Model**

It is used to estimate how much profit a customer can generate on average per trade.
